This is an initial description of the idea.

# General Description
This project is a tool for exploring available options, creative search and brainstorming. It lets user add a single initial prompt and then iterate on it by choosing branching options from what it suggested. Let's say user wants to build a game but not shure what kind of game. They start new session by typing in "browser game" and get 4 options: "Strategy and Simulation Games, Action and Adventure Games, Puzzle and Logic Games, Role-Playing and Story-Driven Games". They choose one of them and it creates 4 new ones. Each of the 4 options on each step has "add prompt" button to specify whatever is needed. There's also 5th option - "specify" - that acts the same way as "add prompt" but is not added to an existing option and exists separately.

# User Experience
The project looks like a ChatGPT window but instead of the chat section there's a canvas for the tree-like structure created by user. Sidebar consists of a name of the app, "new" button, and a list of sessions/trees. When user clicks "new" button, a block for the initial prompt is created on the newly opened canvas. It contains an input field and a "send" button. After sending input field is replaced with the prompt text. On the right from it 5 new blocks are created. 4 for the options that had just been generated and the 5th is a "specify" button. All of them connected to the initial prompt block with arrows.

If user clicks one of the options the process is repeated, 4 options and "specify" button connected to the parent option by arrows are created.

If user clicks "add prompt" next to one of the options, an input field with a submit button appers under the title and on submission this prompt is added under the option name. Under the hood it added as the "prompt". getChildren is called to generate 4 new options.

If user chooses "specify", its the same but there's no option name, just this new prompt with 4 new options generated on the right. Under the hood, 5th child is added to the same parent with this prompt and with empty title. getChildren is called to generate 4 new options.

# Visual
All blocks on the canvas have the same style. Soft, modern, rounded. Arrows are curved, start on the right of a block, end on the left of another block. Blocks cannot overlap or be too close, they push each other if needed with a physically realistic animation. They can be drag'n'dropped.

Sidebar is fully transparent, only the elements on it are visible. Tree/session names look like they're the same blocks as all the others. When new session is sceated new sidebar item with a placeholder title "New session" is added and canvas is opened. There's only one block on the canvas (initial prompt input), right next to the title on the sidebar. They're connected by an arrow like any other blocks. After submitting the initial prompt, session name is generated and added to the sidebar. Input field on the initial prompt block becomes a text and first set of options is generated.

Option names are titles same as session/tree name in the first block. Prompts added by user including initial prompt is plain text. Input field with a submit button is created under the title of a block and removed after submission replaced with the prompt text.

# Under the Hood
The whole tree is described by a JSON and is updated as soon as the JSON is updated. It looks like this (example):
```json
{
  "title": "Browser game", // generated after receiving the initial prompt by getSessionName() and used on the sidebar as a session name
  "prompt": "", // initial prompt, user input; added at the moment of creation of the json and the tree
  "children": [ // first 4 children generated right away by getChildren()
    {
      "title": "Strategy and Simulation Games",
      "prompt": "", // added when Add prompt button next to the option name is used; same for all other children and subchildren
      "children": [] // generated by getChildren() when this option is clicked; same; same for all other children and subchildren
    },
    {
      "title": "Action and Adventure Games",
      "prompt": "",
      "children": []
    },
    {
      "title": "Puzzle and Logic Games",
      "prompt": "",
      "children": [
        {
          "title": "Physics-Based Puzzles",
          "prompt": "",
          "children": []
        },
        {
          "title": "Word and Language Games",
          "prompt": "",
          "children": [
            { "title": "Crossword and Anagram Games", "prompt": "", "children": [] },
            { "title": "Typing Speed and Accuracy Games", "prompt": "", "children": [] },
            { "title": "Vocabulary and Definition Challenges", "prompt": "", "children": [] },
            {
              "title": "Word Association and Chain Games",
              "prompt": "",
              "children": [
                { "title": "Classic Word Chain (last-letter linking)", "prompt": "", "children": [] },
                { "title": "Thematic Association (connect by meaning or topic)", "prompt": "", "children": [] },
                { "title": "Opposites and Antonyms Chain", "prompt": "", "children": [] },
                { "title": "Synonym Relay", "prompt": "", "children": [] }
              ]
            }
          ]
        },
        { "title": "Match-Three and Tile-Matching Games", "prompt": "", "children": [] },
        { "title": "Logic and Riddle Challenges", "prompt": "", "children": [] }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Role-Playing and Story-Driven Games",
      "prompt": "",
      "children": []
    }
  ]
}
```
"Specify" button exists in UI only until used. If user does so, a new child is added to the same parent the button comes from. The block is updated then to become a new option with a newly added prompt but without a name/title. New "specify" button is added automatically by the UI because (no addidional functions or rules, it's created always in addition to the existing options/children).
